# Jeenius
A website somewhat related to academics, started in lockdown. But I keep on adding other not-so-related stuff too.  

You can view all pages at [jeenius.ga](http://jeenius.ga)

## Home

A normal homepage. Submit questions here, which will be added to the Daily section.

## Tests

Here I have a login page with instructions about how to take the online test. It keeps track of your time spent on each question, bookmarked questions and shows attempted/unattempted/not
viewed questions in a progress bar at the top. Also has a Dark Mode. Start your test [here.](http://jeenius.ga/tests/login.php)

## Daily

This is for practising questions. I used to put up new questions daily, so I named it as "Daily". You can bookmark questions and also "share" a question by adding ?q={question_number}
at the end of the url. Ex. [jeenius.ga/daily/physicsq.php?q=10](http://jeenius.ga/daily/physicsq.php?q=10) will directly take you to the 10th question.

## Blank Tests or Custom Tests

If you are solving a question paper and want to mark MCQ answers and check instantaneously, these pages will do that for you. The first one is just a modification of the Tests page where it records time but can only take single choice answers. The other one is a single page which checks any answer against your answer key provided. You can try it [here](http://jeenius.ga/tests/)

## Timetable

The simplest timetable maker - with save and share feature! I have also made a simple edit support for existing timetables. Check it out [here.](http://jeenius.ga/timetable)

## Credits

Just an attempt at copying the credits which play after a movie. Too many setTimeouts. Watch it [here.](http://jeenius.ga/credits-enter.html)

## Forms for cutoffs estimation

A simple form which collects your score, your college and branch and shows the cutoffs using the data. Find cutoffs [here.](http://jeenius.ga/forms/list.php) Submit your response [here.](http://jeenius.ga/forms/)

## Chatting

A very simple chatting webpage using AJAX and PHP with a profanity filter. Try [chatting here.](http://jeenius.ga/text)

## Secured chatting

A more secured chatting app. Your messages are encrypted using a custom key you provide to the system. Hence each "key" becomes like a chatting room (or a group) since only the messages encrypted with that key are displayed. Find out more and [test it here.](http://superboy-ash.ga/secured)

## Chatting with more features

I added support for deleting messages and sending images. Check it out [here (requires login).](http://superboy-ash.ga/talk/)

## 20 Questions

To play the popular game called 20 questions. Essentially a chatting webapp, but this has rooms and player list along with quick answer buttons for the answerer. Play it [here.](http://jeenius.ga/20questions)

## Cubing timer

A clean cubing timer with auto generated scrambles. Customisation settings yet to be added. Time your solves [here.](http://jeenius.ga/timer.php)

## Percentile / GPA calculator

This reads data for each student and gives your score, percentile and GPA. Requires data of all students. Find your score [here.](http://jeenius.ga/things/percentile.html)

## Online Compiler

Just tried my hand at the Jdoodle API which allows 100 calls per day. Compile your program [here.](http://jeenius.ga/compile.html)

## Chemistry tricks

Chemistry tricks that I made and compiled. [Check them out!](http://jeenius.ga/things/checktricks.php)
