# Jeenius
A fun website somewhat related to academics. I keep on adding other not-so-related stuff too.  

You can view all pages at [jeenius.ga](http://jeenius.ga)

## Tests

Here I have a login page with instructions about how to take the online test. It keeps track of your time spent on each question, bookmarked questions and shows attempted/unattempted/not
viewed questions in a progress bar at the top. Also has a Dark Mode.

## Daily

This is for practising questions. I used to put up new questions daily, so I named it as "Daily". You can bookmark questions and also "share" a question by adding ?q={question_number}
at the end of the url. Ex. [jeenius.ga/daily/physicsq.php?q=10](http://jeenius.ga/daily/physicsq.php?q=10) will directly take you to the 10th question.
